CHANGELOG:
================
- I think This Should Be a Complete Release, Considering that Most of the Shit is Already Done
- if offline, there will be a Default icon for all of the "accounts"
- when online, It will Cache The icons and download the icons......
- So If You delete the Cache Folder, The Program will Not Stop Working
- Using Cache to load images
- Finally Gonna Work With DARK MODE and LIGHT MODE
- Stability Fixes
